# FarmIT
End to end help for farmers 

## Overview
Many farmers are losing interest in Agriculture due to lack of resources and manpower. Our focus is on providing the space and materials to cultivate with the right guidance from the Agriculture expert. A weekly alert is notified to the farmers w.r.t rain, machinery, manpower through SMS or mobile apps. After yield is harvested getting the right price is always a problem. Identifying and notifying the farmer about the best selling Mandi for the crop is done through a regularized Android app regulated by an Agriculturist expert or Agriculturist himself.
